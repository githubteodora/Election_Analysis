# Election Analysis
## Project overview
The code for this project is written in python 3. It uses the csv and os python packages, as well as loops (while, for), logical operators, dictionaries, etc. The goal of the project was to automate the analysis of election results, producing a summary of the results, recorded as a separate txt file.
This project also helps demonstrate the Visual Studio Code -> GitHub syn process via GitBash (on Windows).

1. Caludate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes (disctinct names).
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
6. Analyze the vote per county.
