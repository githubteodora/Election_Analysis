# Election Analysis
## Project overview
The code for this project is written in python 3. It uses the csv and os python packages, as well as loops (while, for), logical operators, dictionaries, etc. The goal of the project was to automate the analysis of election results, producing a summary of the results, recorded as a separate txt file.
This project also helps demonstrate the Visual Studio Code -> GitHub syn process via GitBash (on Windows).
